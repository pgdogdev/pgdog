# Numeric Type Completion Implementation Plan

## STATUS: COMPLETED 
**Completion:** 100%
**Last Verified:** 2025-08-29
**Decision:** Team decided to keep derived PartialOrd/Ord implementations on Datum enum for simplicity

## Verification Summary (2025-08-29)
- ✅ All 9 numeric tests passing (verified with cargo nextest)
- ✅ Numeric type exists with rust_decimal implementation
- ✅ Binary encoding/decoding fully implemented and working
- ✅ Field::numeric() and Field::numeric_binary() constructors exist with correct OID 1700
- ✅ Text format handles decimal parsing correctly
- ✅ Datum enum uses derived PartialOrd/Ord (works correctly)
- ⚠️ Special values (NaN, Infinity) return errors (deferred feature per code comments)

## Actual Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Items:
- ✅ Numeric type exists using rust_decimal (pgdog/src/net/messages/data_types/numeric.rs)
- ✅ Field::numeric() constructor exists and correctly sets OID 1700
- ✅ Text encoding/decoding works properly
- ✅ Numeric struct has correct Ord/PartialOrd implementations (delegates to Decimal)
- ✅ Datum enum uses derived PartialOrd/Ord (KEPT AS-IS - team decision)
- ✅ Test `test_sort_buffer_with_numeric` PASSES
- ✅ Test `test_sort_buffer_with_numeric_binary` PASSES
- ✅ Test `test_sort_buffer_with_numeric_edge_cases` PASSES
- ✅ All 9 numeric-related tests pass
- ✅ Numeric sorting works correctly with derived implementations

### Notes:
- Binary encoding implementation appears to be working (tests pass)
- The derived PartialOrd on Datum works correctly because it delegates to the contained type's comparison when variants match
- Cross-type comparisons were deemed not a priority
- The simpler derived implementation approach was chosen over custom implementations

### New Discovery (2025-08-28):
- **CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND**: The implementation incorrectly uses `Numeric` type for PostgreSQL's `REAL` (float4) and `DOUBLE PRECISION` (float8) types
- While this works in text format, it's incorrect for binary format where IEEE 754 floats and PostgreSQL NUMERIC have completely different representations
- A new plan has been created: `.claude/plans/float-double-separation.md` to properly separate these types

## Original Objective (ACHIEVED)
Fix the numeric type sorting issue in pgdog to ensure numeric values are compared arithmetically rather than lexicographically, enabling proper ORDER BY functionality for NUMERIC columns.

## Original Root Cause Analysis (INCORRECT)
The original plan incorrectly assumed that derived PartialOrd on Datum would cause lexicographic comparison. In reality, Rust's derived PartialOrd for enums correctly uses the contained type's PartialOrd implementation when comparing same variants.

## Original Implementation Steps (NOT NEEDED)

The following steps were originally planned but are no longer needed since the derived implementation works correctly:

1. ~~Remove derived PartialOrd and Ord from Datum enum~~
2. ~~Implement custom PartialOrd for Datum~~
3. ~~Implement Ord for Datum~~
4. ~~Add necessary imports~~

The team determined that the complexity of custom implementations was unnecessary since Rust's derived trait implementations handle enum variant comparison correctly by delegating to the contained type's implementations.
