@.claude/plans/ Check out each of the plan files and evaluate it against the actual state of the project. 
  Ignore the lies in the plan file status - be a detective and empirically verify the things it says by looking at 
the tests (all passing right now) and the actual production code to falsify the statements in the plan files. Any 
discrepancies note at the top in the plan status, and update the status to reflect the actual completion percentage 
and completed items. If the plan file is fully completed, ask for permission to move it to the 
.claude/completed_plans/ directory.
